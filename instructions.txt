1. Heat the olive oil in a large skillet over high heat. Add the cauliflower, poblano, and onion. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the cauliflower is charring, about 5 minutes. Add the chipotle peppers, enchilada sauce, oregano, salt, and 1/3 cup water. Reduce the heat to medium and simmer until the sauce has thickened slightly, about 10 minutes.
2. Meanwhile, make the Jalapeño Verde. Combine all ingredients in a blender and blend until smooth and creamy. Season with salt.
3. To serve, stuff the avocado, corn, and cauliflower into the warmed tortillas. Top with jalapeño verde sauce and crumbled cheese.
